# Dice Roller

This is the code from a project I previously completed, an arduino-based dice roller. It uses an OLED display, rotary encoder, and two buttons to generate random numbers.

To view a more in-depth explanation of the build process, take a look at the blog post on my website [here]

Or look at the upcoming instructables project (coming soon!).
